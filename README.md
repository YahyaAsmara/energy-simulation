# Raspberry Pi GPIO Energy Simulation (WIP)

> ⚠️ **Project Status**: Work in progress - conceptual project not yet implemented.

## Overview

Simulates electrical energy flow and current behavior between hardware GPIO pins and Raspberry Pi systems with real-time visualization and interactive circuit design.

## Planned Features

- **GPIO Simulation**: Virtual Raspberry Pi GPIO pin representation
- **Circuit Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating circuits
- **Real-time Visualization**: Current flow, voltage, and power consumption monitoring
- **3D Circuit View**: Three.js-powered circuit representation
- **Hardware Integration**: Connect to actual Raspberry Pi GPIO (optional)
- **Data Export**: Historical power consumption analysis

## Technologies (Proposed)

**Frontend**: React, Three.js (3D visualization), D3.js (charts), Tailwind CSS
**Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io, SQLite
**Hardware**: Johnny-Five, Raspi-io, RPi.GPIO
**Processing**: WebAssembly for calculations, Web Workers

## Architecture Concept

```
GPIO Pins ──┐
            ├── Simulation Engine ── Real-time Data ── 3D Visualization
Circuit  ───┤     (Ohm's Law,                    │
Design   ───┘     Kirchhoff's Laws)              └── Data Export
```

## Key Algorithms (Planned)

- **Ohm's Law**: V = I × R calculations
- **Kirchhoff's Laws**: Current and voltage analysis  
- **Power Dissipation**: P = V × I modeling
- **Signal Processing**: Digital/analog signal simulation

## Quick Start (Conceptual)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pi-energy-simulation.git
cd pi-energy-simulation
npm install
npm run dev    # Frontend
npm run server # Backend simulation
```

## Use Cases

- Educational tool for learning electronics
- Circuit prototyping before hardware implementation  
- Power consumption analysis and optimization
- GPIO pin behavior simulation and testing
